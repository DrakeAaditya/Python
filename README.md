### Assignment 36: Dictionary - Demo

Objective: Given a Dictionary of elements representing a computational problem, be able to perform different operations using an object oriented language (Python) on Eclipse IDE

Problem Description: Given below is a Dictionary customer_details representing customer Details from Retail Application - Customer Id is key and Customer Name is value.
```
customer_details = { 1001 : "John", 1004 : "Jill", 1005: "Joe", 1003 : "Jack" }
```
Write Python code to perform below mentioned operations:
a. Print details of Customers
b. Print number of Customers
c. Print Customer names in ascending order
d. Delete the details of customer with customer id = 1005 and print updated dictionary
e. Update the name of customer with customer id = 1003 to “Mary” and print updated dictionary
f. Check whether details of customer with customer id 1002 exists in the dictionary.

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have learnt the implementation of Dictionary operations for given business scenario.
